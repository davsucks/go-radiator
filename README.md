# Go-Radiator

I just want to radiate go :O

### Setup

* Clone
* `$npm install`
* Set up a cron job to run `curRequest.sh` every minute and save the file to the project directory or something
	* (I have an example request since you need to be VPN'd for the curl request to work)
* Replace hard-coded file path in `routes/index.js` to wherever you saved the file in the previous step
* `$nodemon npm start`
* localhost:3000
* ???
* Profit!

### TODO:
* have angular poll the json file every minute for updates
